# UPOBattleship by Lorenzo Rossi [20031485]
Java project for the Programming Paradigms course at University of Eastern Piedmont, Vercelli (IT).

Added:
 - `BattleshipStartLoadWindow` as start screen, where you choose whether to start a new game or load a previous one;
 - `BattleshipExitFrame` for when you press *x* to exit the start screen: it displays an *are you sure* window **[NEEDS FIXING]**;
 - `BattleshipWindowDestructor` to make `BattleshipExitFrame` visible when pressing *x* while in `BattleshipStartLoadWindow`.
