# UPOBattleship - Programming Paradigms Java project
Java project for the Programming Paradigms course at University of Eastern Piedmont, Vercelli (IT).

# Latest additions/fixes
 - **FIXED:** bug in `Computer`'s `lineCheck()` smart aiming method;
 - Semi-functioning terminal version (launch BattleshipModel.main() for a trial);

# TODO
 - [x] Implement smart `Computer` aiming methods: `crossCheck()` works, but `linearCheck()` needs fixing;
 - [x] Implement system to tell model or computer if the last two hits were successful;
 - [ ] Implement `SetShipsController`;
 - [ ] Implement `BattlePanel`;
 - [ ] Implement `BattleController`;
 - [ ] Implement `PlayerTest` and `ShipTest`;
 - [ ] Check if some `Exception`s can be launched - add them if so;
 - [ ] Implement `Timer` from javax.swing for a basic countdown if the "Timed" box is checked;
 - [ ] Write JavaDOC.
