# UPOBattleship - Programming Paradigms Java project
Java project for the Programming Paradigms course at University of Eastern Piedmont, Vercelli (IT).

# Latest additions
**HORY SHET IT (KINDA) WORKS!**
Throught strenuous trials and errors, we have finally reached a good point: the MVC model works so far. It successfully displays "Load game" only if a saved file exists, and the view goes up to the "New Game Settings" panel, i.e. the second one. 

# TODO
- Check for _essential features_ in the project document: we might be missing something important!
- Implement the third view, `BattleshipSetNamePanel`, and its controller, `BattleshipSetNameController`. Then the following view will be `BattleshipSetShipsPanel`+`BattleshipSetShipsController`, which is incubating in Paco's hands.
