# UPOBattleship - Programming Paradigms Java project
Java project for the Programming Paradigms course at University of Eastern Piedmont, Vercelli (IT).

# Latest additions
Trying to merge Paco's code into Lorenzo's + package hierarchy established.

# TODO
 - Implement `Timer` from javax.swing for a basic countdown if the "Timed" box is checked;
 - Merge Paco's code with Lorenzo's to create `BattleshipSetShipsPanel` and to implement `BattleshipPlayer`'s methods for setting each ship;
 - As soon as Paco's finished implementing the player's methods for shooting a ship, we are basically done;
 - Check if some `Exception`s can be launched - add them if so;
 - JavaDOC.

# Useful links
 - [Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) because Lorenzo  _always_  forgets stuff;
 - [Swing Timer](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/timer.html) for game loss condition;
 - [MVC paradigm](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/javase/application-design-with-mvc.html) to clearly understand how to implement things;
 - [PropertyChangeSupport and PropertyChangeListener](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/javabeans/writing/properties.html#bound) in JavaBeans, because `Observable` and `Observer` are deprecated since Java 9.
