# UPOBattleship - Programming Paradigms Java project
Java project for the Programming Paradigms course at University of Eastern Piedmont, Vercelli (IT).

# Latest additions/fixes
The game is fully playable, with both mods easy/hard and timed.

# TODO
 - [ ] **FIX** `BattleshipModel::saveGame()` and `BattleshipModel::loadGame()`: they work in tests, but they don't communicate well with the GUI;
 - [ ] Implement `BattleshipModelTest`;
 - [ ] Check if some `Exception`s can be launched - add them if so;
 - [ ] Write JavaDOC - **ongoing**.
